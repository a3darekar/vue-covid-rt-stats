## This project is no longer maintained

In the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, I used Rt as a useful measure of how quickly the coronavirus was spreading. However, since the existence of multiple mutations and existence of better metrics, I now believe other metrics are a better way to track the data. This project is no longer maintained and the data reported not be updated.

## About the Project

Rt also referred to as the reproduction number is a mathematical term that determines how contagious a particular disease is. It gives us an insight into the coronavirus spread across India. This application provides average R nought values calculated from the data obtained from a [third party API](covid19india.org) collected daily.
This model is inspired by rt.live. Please check out the FAQs on the [site](https://india-rt.netlify.app/) to Learn more.
