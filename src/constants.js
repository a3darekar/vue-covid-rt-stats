			"question": "What is R<sub>t</sub>/R<sub>0</sub>?",
			"answer":  "R<sub>0</sub>, pronounced “R naught,” is a mathematical term that indicates how contagious an infectious disease is. It’s also referred to as the reproduction number. As an infection is transmitted to new people, it reproduces itself."
		},
		{
			"question": "Why R<sub>0</sub>?",
			"answer":  "<p>R<sub>0</sub> tells you the average number of people who will contract a contagious disease from one person with that disease. For example, if a disease has an R<sub>0</sub> of 4, a person who has the disease will transmit it to an average of 4 other people. That replication will continue if no one has been vaccinated against the disease or is already immune to it in their community. <a style='color: red; text-decoration: underline red;' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number'>Know More</a></p>"

		{
			"question": "What does the 'R<sub>t</sub>' value mean?",
			"answer":  "<p>Three possibilities exist for the potential transmission of a disease, depending on the R<sub>t</sub> value:</p>\
				<ul class='list-disc pl-5'> \
					<li> \
					</p>If Rt is less than 1, each existing infection spreads to less than one new infection. This means the desease spread will decline and it will eventually die out.</p> \
					</li> \
					<li> \
					</p>If Rt is 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. This means the \
					desease spread will stay stable but there won't be an outbreak.</p> \
					</li> \
					<li> \
					</p>If Rt is greater than 1, each existing infection spreads to more than one new infection. This means the \
					desease will spread among the community and there may be an outbreak or even a pandemic.</p> \
					</li> \
				</ul> \
				<p>The Rt is only applicable to the population that is completely vulnerable to the disease.</p>"
